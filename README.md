# AlBannaDesigner-OpenGL
This is opengl-multi-core  program i create it when i learn open gl
this source code consist of many parts 
#### so : to run any part you need to convert `#if 0` to `#if 1` 
> Warn : You can't run/build many cores at the same time `There is just one start point`

### Notic
due to github repository size limitation and git tracking system limitation with binary/blob files
I can not provide dll files and exe files here since it is not in git tracking system
so this may force you to download all those files manualy 
##### For that,
I Upload the whole project to mega cloude, so you can just download it , and use it directly
Also notice it's includes all generated binary files for all development steps
including `fractal shader engine`

###### Also notice:
due to complexity of containing pure OpenGl window inside HWND pointer wrappers for most of libraries I record this video to explain
containing openGL inside Qt container `only qt dlls needed, without need to qt creator/studio or any scaffolding or WISWIG tools` this video i pretty long `1:46:16` Also i used java `i used java for this demonstration , you can use what you want` to get/update dll references in C++ project
